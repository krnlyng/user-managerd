  \title Sailfish User Manager Daemon

  Daemon for handling Sailfish OS device users.

  This daemon provides D-Bus API for adding, removing and editing additional
  Sailfish OS device users. The main system user is created during the first
  boot of the device. This user can then use this API to add additional users
  which have access only to some of the available functionality and services.

  \section1 Using Sailfish User Manager Daemon

  Sailfish User Manager Daemon is used through \c org.sailfishos.usermanager
  D-Bus service.

  \section2 D-Bus API

  See \l SailfishUserManager for more information about
  \c org.sailfishos.usermanager interface.

  There is \l <sailfishusermanagerinterface.h> header that provides useful
  definitions for the D-Bus API.

  \section2 User types

  By default devices have only \e {device owner} which has permissions to do
  anything on the device unless prohibited by a device policy. \l
  SailfishUserManager::addUser can be used to create \e {additional users} that
  have less permissions and to whom disk quota applies. In addition to these
  there can be one \e {guest user} for which any data created by the user is
  destroyed at the end of session. \e {Guest user} is enabled and disabled with
  separate interface \l SailfishUserManager::enableGuestUser. Any restrictions
  that apply to \e {additional user} also apply to \e {guest user}.

  \section1 Operation

  Systemd launches the daemon automatically when a call to the interface is
  made. In the case of an error a D-Bus error is responded. The daemon quits
  after one minute if there are no more incoming messages.

  \section2 Quota

  By default new users are set to have quota for /home partition and they may
  reserve at most 20 % of blocks or 2 GB whichever is smaller. Hard limit is set
  to 120 % of the soft limit but soft limit will become hard limit after grace
  period (default is 7 days). Quota limits are set only on user creation and can
  be adjusted with setquota afterwards. If kernel does not support quota or it
  is not enabled on /home partition the limits are not set.
